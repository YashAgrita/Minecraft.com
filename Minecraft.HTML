<FONT COLOR=GREEN<I><B>Minecraft is a sandbox video game developed by Mojang Studios. The game was created by Markus "Notch" Persson in the Java programming language. Following several early private testing
 versions,
 it was first made public in May 2009 before being fully released in November 2011,

 with Notch stepping down and Jens "Jeb" Bergensten taking over development.
 
Minecraft has since been ported to several other platforms and is the best-selling video game of all time, with over 238 million copies sold and nearly 140 million monthly active players
 as of 2021.

<H1>Gameplay</H1>
<pre><hr color=green>
<FONT COLOR=GREEN<I><B>Minecraft is a 3D sandbox game that has no required goals to accomplish,
 allowing players a large amount of freedom in choosing how to play the game. However, there is an achievement system, known as "advancements"
 in the Java Edition of the game, and "trophies" on the PlayStation ports.Gameplay is in the first-person perspective
 by default, but players have the option of a third-person perspective. The game world is composed of rough 
3D objects—mainly cubes and fluids, and commonly called "blocks"—representing
 various materials, such as dirt, stone, ores, tree trunks, water, and lava.
 The core gameplay revolves around picking up and placing these objects. These
 blocks are arranged in a 3D grid, while players can move freely around the world.
 Players can "mine" blocks and then place them elsewhere, enabling them to build things. Many commentators have described the game's physics system as
 unrealistic. The game also contains a material called redstone,
 which can be used to make primitive mechanical devices, electrical
 circuits, and logic gates, allowing for the construction of many complex
 systems.

<H1><i><u>Game Modes</i></b></u></h1>
<h3><i><u>Survival Mode</i></b></u>S</h3>
In survival mode, players have to gather natural resources such as wood
 and stone found in the environment in order to craft certain blocks
 and items. Depending on the difficulty, monsters spawn in darker areas
 outside a certain radius of the character, requiring players to build a 
shelter at night. The mode also has a health bar which is depleted by
 attacks from mobs,
 falls, drowning, falling into lava, suffocation, starvation, and other
 events. Players also have a hunger bar, which must be periodically 
refilled by eating food in-game, except in peaceful difficulty. 
If the hunger bar is depleted, automatic healing will stop and eventually 
health will deplete. Health replenishes when players have a nearly full 
hunger bar or continuously on peaceful difficulty.<br><br>
Players can craft a wide variety of items in Minecraft.
 Craftable items include armor, which mitigates damage from attacks;
 weapons (such as swords or axes), which allows monsters and animals
 to be killed more easily; and tools, which break certain types of blocks more quickly.
 Some items have multiple tiers depending on the material used
 to craft them, with higher-tier items being more effective and durable. 
Players can construct furnaces, which can cook food, process ores,
 and convert materials into other materials. Players may also exchange 
goods with
 a villager (NPC) through a trading system, which involves trading
 emeralds for different goods and vice versa.<br><br>
The game has an inventory system, allowing players to carry a 
limited number of items. Upon dying, items in the players' inventories
 are dropped unless the game is reconfigured not to do so. Players then
 re-spawn at their spawn point, which by default is where players first
 spawn in the game and can be reset by sleeping in a bed or using
 a respawn anchor. Dropped items can be recovered if players can 
reach them before they disappear or despawn after 5 minutes. Players 
may acquire experience points by killing mobs and other players,
 mining, smelting ores, breeding animals, and cooking food. Experience
 can then be spent on enchanting tools, armor and weapons. Enchanted
 items are generally more powerful, last longer, or have other special
 effects


<h3><i><b><u>Hardcore mode</i></b></u></h3>
Hardcore mode is a survival mode variant that is locked to the hardest
 setting and has permadeath. If a player dies in a hardcore world,
 they are no longer allowed to interact with it, so they can either be
 put into spectator mode and explore the world or delete it entirely.
This game
 mode can only be accessed within the Java Edition of Minecraft

<h3><i><b><u>Creative mode</i></b></u></h3>
In creative mode, players have access to nearly all resources and items
 in the game through the inventory menu and can place or remove them
 instantly. Players can toggle the ability to fly freely around the
 game world at will, and their characters do not take any damage and are 
not affected by hunger. The game mode helps players focus on
 building and creating projects of any size without disturbance

<h3><i><b><u>Adventure mode</i></b></u></h3>
Adventure mode was designed specifically so that players could
 experience user-created custom maps and adventures.
 The gameplay is similar to survival mode but with various restrictions, 
which can be applied to the game world by the creator of the map. This
 forces players to obtain the required items and experience adventures
 in the way that the map maker intended. Another addition designed
 for custom maps is the command block; this block allows map makers
 to expand interactions with players through scripted server commands

<h3><i><b><u>Spectator mode</i></b></u></h3>
Spectator mode allows players to fly through blocks and watch gameplay without directly interacting. Players do not have an inventory but can
 teleport to other players and view from the perspective of another
 player or creature. This game mode can only be accessed within Java
 Edition and Console Legacy Editions. However, the Bedrock Edition
 development team is in the process of implementing it.
<h2><i><b><u>Multiplayer</h2></i></b></u></h2>
Multiplayer in Minecraft enables multiple players to interact and 
communicate with each other on a single world. It is available through
 direct game-to-game multiplayer, LAN play, local split screen (console-only),
 and servers (player-hosted and business-hosted). Players can run their
 own servers, use a hosting provider, or connect directly to another 
player's game via Xbox Live. Single-player worlds have local area
 network support, allowing players to join a world on locally 
interconnected computers without a server setup. Minecraft 
multiplayer servers are guided by server operators, who have 
access to server commands such as setting the time of day and 
teleporting players. Operators can also set up restrictions 
concerning which usernames or IP addresses are allowed or disallowed
 to enter the server. Multiplayer servers have a wide range of 
activities, with some servers having their own unique rules and customs.
 The largest and most popular server is Hypixel, which has been visited
 by over 14 million unique players. Player versus player combat
 (PvP) can be enabled to allow fighting between players. Many servers
 have custom plugins that allow actions that are not normally possible
<h1><i><u><b>Minecraft:Pocket Edition</h1></i></b></u>
In August 2011, Minecraft: Pocket Edition was released for the Xperia
 Play on the Android Market as an early alpha version. It was then
 released for several other compatible devices on 8 October 2011.
 An iOS version of Minecraft was released on 17 November 2011. A
 port was made available for Windows Phones shortly after Microsoft
 acquired Mojang. The port concentrates on the creative building and
 the primitive survival aspect of the game, and does not contain all
 the features of the PC release. On his Twitter account, Jens
 Bergensten said that the Pocket Edition of Minecraft is written
 in C++ and not Java, due to iOS not being able to support Java.
 However, there now exists a way to play Java Edition on both Android
 and iOS devices<br><br>
On 10 December 2014, a port of Pocket Edition was released for Windows
 Phone 8.1. In January 2017, Microsoft announced that it would no
 longer maintain the Windows Phone versions of Pocket Edition.
 On 19 December 2016, the full version of Minecraft: Pocket Edition
 was released on iOS, Android and Windows Phone.<br><br>
Pocket Edition was replaced by Minecraft: Bedrock Edition in 2017,
 enabling cross-platform play with the Xbox One and Nintendo Switch
 Editions.
